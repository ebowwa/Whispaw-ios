#  Models Readme

In iOS development, there are two main types of components: models and views. Understanding the difference between them is crucial for building well-structured and maintainable apps. Here's an explanation of the differences between models and views:

Models:

Purpose: Models represent the data and business logic of your application. They encapsulate the information that your app needs to function, independent of how it's presented to the user.
Data Representation: Models are used to store, manage, and manipulate data. They define the structure and relationships between different types of data in your app.
Examples: User profiles, products, tasks, locations, and settings are all examples of data that would be represented by models. For instance, a User model might have properties like name, email, and profilePicture.
Responsibilities: Models are responsible for holding data, validating it, and providing methods to interact with that data. They typically don't have any knowledge of how the data is displayed or presented to the user.
Code Location: Model code is usually placed in separate files or folders, such as a "Models" folder, to keep it separate from the user interface code.
